<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of choice. To build this project, we can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.</p>

<h3>Why This Project?<h3>
<p>With Score Keeper, we will be practicing this skill set, with particular focus on button code, variable scope, and updating views. This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding button code to the app</li>
  <li>Updating views</li>
  <li>Properly scoping variables</li>
  <li>Finding views by their ID</li>
</ul>
